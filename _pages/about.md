I'm a Master's student in **Robotics, Systems and Control** at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), passionate about building intelligent machines that interact with the physical world. My work lies at the intersection of **robot motion planning**, **control**, and **perception**, with a focus on creating algorithms that are both efficient and physically grounded.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve contributed to a wide range of robotics researchâ€”from trajectory optimization on **3D Gaussian Splatting** representations, to soft robotic manipulation with **rope-based grippers**, to motion planning for **robotic juggling**. Along the way, I've collaborated on both simulation and real-world deployments, including the **ANYmal quadruped** and automated construction at **Gravis Robotics**.

What excites me most is tackling complex physical interaction problems with a clean algorithmic lensâ€”whether that means planning around uncertainties or accelerating control pipelines on GPU.
