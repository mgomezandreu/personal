Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Robotics, Systems and Control at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). Iâ€™m interested in building intelligent machines that can understand and interact with the physical world. 
My work is at the intersection of robot motion planning, control, and perception, with a focus on making algorithms that are both efficient and physically accurate.
I view robotics as an important conerstone to further our understanding of AI and our own mind. I strongly believe that the development of intelligence is strongly couple to interaction with the real world.

Iâ€™ve worked on a range of robotics projects â€” from trajectory optimization using 3D Gaussian Splatting, to soft robotic manipulation with rope-based grippers, to motion planning for robotic juggling. My experience includes both simulation and real-world systems, such as the ANYmal quadruped and automated excavators with Gravis Robotics.

Apart from research I love running, rowing at Polytechnic Rowing Club in Zurich and dancing Salsa Cubana. I enjoy getting to know new perspectives on life and debating complex philosophical, sociatal and technical issues. 

If you are interested in what I do, please reach out. I am always down for coffee!
