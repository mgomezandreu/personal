Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in **Robotics, Systems and Control** at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). Iâ€™m interested in building intelligent machines that can understand and interact with the physical world. My work is at the intersection of **robot motion planning**, **control**, and **perception**, with a focus on making algorithms that are both efficient and physically accurate.

Iâ€™ve worked on a range of robotics projects â€” from trajectory optimization using **3D Gaussian Splatting**, to soft robotic manipulation with **rope-based grippers**, to motion planning for **robotic juggling**. My experience includes both simulation and real-world systems, such as the **ANYmal quadruped** and automated excavators with **Gravis Robotics**.
